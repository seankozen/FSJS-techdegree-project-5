# FSJS-techdegree-project-5
 Student Directory

 The following stylistic changes were made:
    1. The background color of the main page was changed to rgba(39, 114, 77, 0.2).
    2. Shadows were added to the employee cards and the search box.
    3. The font was changed to Google Font Roboto.

The search function was created to filter the employee cards in realtime, so the search button was deleted from the HTML template.
## How I worked on this project
My goal was to simulate a professional work environment.
- I built this app based on mockup images.
## How to navigate this project
- App can be accessed from the index.html file.
- The application fetches data from the Random User Generator API: [https://github.com/seankozen/API-employee-directory/blob/main/app.js]
- Creation of modal in the app.js file: [https://github.com/seankozen/FSJS-techdegree-project-5/blob/main/app.js].
## Why I built the project this way
- My plan is to become a full-stack developer, but for this project I focused on the
  frontend. That's why I decided to use an existing API.
## If I had more time I would change this
- Recreate using React.js.
